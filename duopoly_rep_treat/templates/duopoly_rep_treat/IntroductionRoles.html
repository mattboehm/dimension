    <h3>This is an experiment studying buyer and seller behavior in a simple market.</h3>
    <p>In each match, the computer will randomly match you into a groups of {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants.  Since there are {{ Constants.num_players }} participants in todays experiment, this will result in {{ num_groups }} groups.  You are not told the identity of the other participants in your group.</p>

    <p>Next, the computer randomly assigns a role to each member of the group: {{ Constants.sellers_per_group }} members will be “sellers” and {{ Constants.buyers_per_group }} members will be “buyers”.</p>

    <p>Sellers act first.  Whenever you act as a seller, you can produce and sell objects to buyers.  You will choose the prices for these objects.</p>

    <p>Buyers act second. Whevever you act as a buyer, you will see the prices the two sellers set, and then choose which seller you wish to purchase from.  You will pay the seller you choose the price that the seller set.</p>
