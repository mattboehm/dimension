            <p>At the end of each match you will see a screen that summarizes your earnings in that match as well as the actions of each player in your group during that match.

                An example of a summary screen is shown to the right.
            </p>
            <p>
                This summary screen shows that in this example match you were "Seller 1", you set prices that summed up to {{ s1_ask_total }}, and buyer 1 bought from you, while buyer 2 bought from the other seller.  Therefore you made {{ subtotal }} tokens ({{ s1_ask_total }} - {{  Constants.prodcost }}) in this match.
